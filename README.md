#  Ilsan Hidayatulloh - Data Analyst Portfolio

##  About Me

Hi, I'm Ilsan! I am an enthusiastic undergraduate student currently advancing into my **5th semester of Information Technology (IT)**. My IT background has given me a robust foundation in logic and problem-solving, which fuels my deep-seated passion for **Data Science and Data Analysis**.

I am driven to leverage my technical skills in **Python and SQL** to transform raw, complex data into clear, actionable business insights.

This repository serves as a space to showcase my abilities, share my end-to-end data analysis projects, and track my continuous growth in the data domain.

##  Portfolio Projects

In this section, I list data analytics projects, briefly describing the technology stack used to solve the cases and the key insights derived.

###  Data Cleaning & Modeling (Python)

#### **H&M Store Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering**

| Category | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Code Access** | **[VIEW PYTHON CODE]** (`ALL_H&M_STORES_WORLDWIDE.ipynb`) |
| **Goal** | To prepare raw store data for advanced visualization, focusing on data quality, handling missing values, and creating the core analytic feature: `Clean StoreClass`. |
| **Description** | Used Python (Pandas) to ingest raw data, perform necessary data validation, and address NULL values in the `StoreClass` column by reclassifying them as "Not yet confirmed." This script ensures data integrity and modeling readiness for Tableau. |
| **Technology** | Python (Pandas) |
| **Result (Output)** | A clean, modeled dataset ready for visualization, forming the foundation of the market analysis. |

### 📊 Data Visualization & Analysis (Tableau)

#### **Global Store Network Analysis: Mapping H&M's Market Presence and Strategy**

| Category | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Dashboard File** | **[DOWNLOAD WORKBOOK]** (`ALL H&M STORES WORLDWIDE.twbx`) |
| **Goal** | To strategically analyze H&M's global store distribution by comparing store quantity, investment quality (*Store Class*), and market density (*City Penetration*). |
| **Description** | Visualized the cleaned dataset in Tableau, featuring a Dual-Axis Chart to compare total stores with city spread across the TOP 20 countries, along with a Stacked Bar Chart for store classification breakdown. |
| **Technology** | Tableau |
| **Key Findings** | The analysis reveals a dual strategy: *Flagship-led investment* in high-priority markets (US, China) and *high-density standard store deployment* in mature European markets. |
